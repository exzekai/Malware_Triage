# Malware_Triage

After reading some of Corey Harrell's paper, it inspired me to just play arounnd and create some PS scripts which can help fasten the malware forensics examination/triage process, documented here as well.

The scripts will cover 3 basic things such-

1-Check program which were ran on the system

2-Check auto-start locations

3-Check File System Artifacts

There maybe other tools such as regripper which will work better to check some of these but will try to do something with PS.
